# Hello, I'm Wojciech👋

Welcome on my site! [bitStudio.dev](https://bitstudio.dev) is creative space where I explore the realms of web & game development. While I haven't released any games just yet, I'm actively participating in [game jams](https://bitstudio.dev/tags/gamejam/) and honing my skills to bring unique and exciting projects to life.

## The story

My coding adventure kicked off with the powerful C++. The challenges of this language laid the foundation for my understanding of programming concepts. It wasn't long before I decided to put my skills to the test by delving into the world of game development.

**C# A First Love, called MonoGame**

My first game was crafted using MonoGame and the C# language. The combination allowed me to bring my ideas to life with ease. The joy of seeing my creations come alive fueled my passion for game development, and I was hungry for more.

**🐍 Python Arcade 🐍**

Eager to expand my horizons, I embraced Python for my next gaming escapade. I explored the Arcade and pyGame libraries, leveraging the simplicity and versatility of Python to create diverse and entertaining games. Python's readability and ease of use brought a new dimension to my development journey.

**🤖🤖 Godot/Unity/Unreal and others 🤖🤖**

With a thirst for knowledge, I ventured into the realms of the Godot game engine. Despite multiple attempts, I discovered that Godot wasn't my perfect match. I tried other engines. Each one was a learning experience, steering me closer to the game development environment that felt just right.

**🦀🦀🦀 Rust and Bevy: A Perfect Match 🦀🦀🦀**

I stumbled upon the Rust programming language and the Bevy game engine. It was love at first code! The performance-oriented nature of Rust, combined with the simplicity and flexibility of Bevy, resonated with me. Now, I find myself lost in the beauty of this powerful duo, creating games that push the boundaries of what I thought was possible.
My Journey Continues

As I continue to explore the ever-evolving landscape of game development, I invite you to join me on this thrilling adventure. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, there's always something new to discover, and I'm excited to share my experiences, insights, and, of course, some cool games with you.
