Hello world! I'm Wojciech. Currently I work as a Site Reliability Engineer in one of cloud companies. In spare time I write about linux management, python packages, web development, no matter is it backend or frontend. If I found something interesting enough I will publish it.

bitStudio is just a one-man-site, so if you want to follow up content on this site, you can follow me as well. If you have any questions, doubts or maybe you found error in article, don't hesitate to send me a message.
