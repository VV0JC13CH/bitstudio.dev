Automation, automation, automation! We have Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt etc. for production purposes, but what about our own desktops? All of these inventions are an overkill for our personal system. Why not use a single script? Of course, I wasn't the first to think of it. That's why I used ready-made solutions ((danishathalye/dotbot)[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot]) to prepare a configuration for people who like working with Vim and Tmux. It is fast, it is efficient, it is safe, and most importantly, I am still developing this repository to meet my expectations. So if you are interested in, clone below repo and change your life 4ever!
