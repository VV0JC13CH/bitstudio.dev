Submission to Text Only Jam [8 Bits to Infinity]
This was my first game jam experience. At the time I made all achievements in Dark Souls on PS3, so I was in "the mood". Since it was my fist experience with Godot and programming overall whole logic was based on x and y of the hero. Nice prototype, it shows something, but it's very short and linear. Enjoy watching :-)
