I wanted to give the player a sense of infinity, boredom, and at the same time give an incentive to persevere to the end.
I was planning to add activities that could kill a fisherman, and only the player could protect him.
This would require the player to sit in front of the computer for an equal hour (infinity, for most of us) to protect the hero so he could land.

Unfortunately I had only something like 2 days in total to make a game. So its more like a POC, than a game. Still, I think this demo has positive vibe and is worth single launch.

tl/dr: It's not a game, it's a nice screensaver.
