Welcome to "Farmer Survivor", a game where you take on the farmer and experience the consequences of your everyday work. Your goal is to manage your farm by completing various tasks such as watering, taking care of animals, and fishing.

But beware, every action you take has a side effect that can either benefit or harm your farm. For example, taking care of flowers will surely attract bees, a fed donkey will definitely not forget about the last dinner, caught mice can attract cats and chopping trees will piss off the beavers!

The game is designed to be played using only arrows and return keys, making it simple and accessible for all players. It has been tested on Linux and WASM, and it's recommended to play on the Linux platform for the best experience :-) .

As you progress through the game, you will encounter unexpected challenges and events that will test your farming skills and decision-making abilities. Will you be able to manage your farm effectively and overcome the side effects of your actions? Play "Farmer Survivor" to find out!
